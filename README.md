# 👋 Hi, I’m Anderson Araújo

**Product Technologist | System Thinker | Builder of Impactful AI-Driven Products**

---

### 🧠 What I Do

I build software systems that turn deep tech into real-world results. With 18+ years across AI, ML, and enterprise-scale platforms, I operate at the intersection of **system architecture**, **product leadership**, and **scientific experimentation**.

My work has:

- Delivered **hundred of millions dollars in business impact** through AI/ML products in production
- Shipped **products used by millions**, from early PoCs to enterprise-grade systems
- Translated **research into revenue** — from ML models to full-stack deployment
- Led **cross-functional teams** from 0→1 and 1→n in startups and scaled orgs

### 🔬 My Approach

Every product starts as a hypothesis. I treat tech like an experiment — testable, measurable, and grounded in outcomes.

1. **Problem First** → Is this worth solving?
2. **Hypothesis Design** → What’s the smallest thing we can test?
3. **System Build** → What scales *and* adapts?
4. **Signal Measurement** → What proves it's working?
5. **Iteration** → What unlocks 10x more?

This method guides everything I ship — from PoCs to production.

### 🧰 My Stack

I go deep where it matters, and stay pragmatic everywhere else.

- **AI/ML**: Python, PyTorch, LangChain, OpenAI APIs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Ops
- **Systems**: FastAPI, Kafka, Postgres, Redis, Docker, Airflow
- **Product**: Experimentation frameworks, data-driven roadmaps, KPI design, A/B testing
- **Infra**: AWS, GCP, CI/CD, Terraform, Kubernetes (when it’s worth it)

### 🚧 Recent Work (WIP Repos → Shipped Products)

- `llm-signal-lab/` – Rapid prototyping space for testing prompt pipelines, RAG stacks, and evaluation harnesses.
- `news-query-llms/` – Lightweight framework for hypothesis-driven product iteration.
- `aichron/` – Proof-of-Concept | AI-powered chat built for clarity, empathy, and scientific grounding

### 🛰️ Operating Principles

- **Signal over noise** – every commit, every metric, every meeting.
- **Build with proof** – ship experiments, not opinions.
- **Systems > hacks** – architecture scales, heroics don't.
- **Be the glue** – products win when tech, design, and business connect.
